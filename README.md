# Step_Counter_Project
*Developed a step counter using the csv data outputted from a phoneâ€™s accelerometer
*The step counter function analyzes:
  *difference between the maximums and minimums of acceleration data
  *magnitude of maximums of acceleration data

My program performed with an overall 2.5% error on regular walking and running data.
