# Step Counter Project
- Developed a step counter that analyzes the csv data outputted from a phoneâ€™s accelerometer

- The step counter function analyzes:
  - difference between the maximums and minimums of acceleration data
  - magnitude of maximums of acceleration data


My program performed with an overall 2.5% error on regular walking and running data.
